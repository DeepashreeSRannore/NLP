# NLP-Email_Extraction_UsingSpacy

A natural language processing project focused on extracting email addresses from unstructured text data using Python libraries including spaCy, Pandas, and NumPy.
This project demonstrates how to extract email addresses from text files containing random details and unstructured information. The implementation leverages the power of spaCy's NLP capabilities combined with data manipulation tools to efficiently process and extract relevant email information.
